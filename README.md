# PRODIGY_ML_03

I am working on a supervised learning task that involves solving a classification problem. 
To accomplish this, I have utilized the "dogs v cats dataset" obtained from Kaggle. 
The dataset comprises 25,000 images of both dogs and cats, and my objective is to train an algorithm using these images in order to predict the labels, where 1 represents a dog and 0 represents a cat.

Given the high dimensionality of the problem, I have chosen to employ the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 
To begin, I loaded the images and performed resizing operations to ensure consistency. 
In order to determine the most suitable parameters for training the model, I applied the Gradient Search Cross Validation technique. 
This method enabled me to search for and identify the optimal set of parameters that would yield the best results for training the SVM model.
